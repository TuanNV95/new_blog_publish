Tại sao game lại vận hành được theo thao tác của người dùng? Tại sao khi có quá nhiều xử lý trong một thời điểm mà vẫn có thể vận hành mượt mà đến vậy?... Ok, khá lan man rồi, kết thúc THPT tôi quyết định thi quân sự (nhìn vậy chứ tôi đủ tiêu chuẩn thi quân đội đấy :)))) ), và trường tôi chọn là Sỹ quan Thông tin. Tôi trượt trong cả 2 năm thi, đến thời điểm đó tôi không còn biết thực sự mình nên học gì và làm gì sắp tới, tôi còn dự định sẽ không tiếp tục học nữa. Nhưng thật là duyên số và bổn phận không cho phép (bố mẹ tôi không có ý định đấy, vậy là bố tôi quyết định tạm thời sẽ cho đi học tại ĐH Vinh - chuyên ngành gì về kinh tế thì phải). Tôi vốn ghét mấy cái sự gò bó, nghe đến kinh tế đã thấy không có cảm hứng rồi. “Bố qua trường con học đi, CNTT điểm nguyện vọng 2 thấp thôi.” đấy là tin nhắn của “con gái” tôi (con gái tôi xinh lắm nhé! :))))). Vậy là tôi xách đít đi học và thành hậu bối của “con gái” mình trong khi bố tôi vẫn mong muốn tôi vào Vinh (do bạn ấy đi học từ năm đầu, còn tôi thi lại 1 năm).

Năm lớp 8 tôi bắt đầu được tạo cảm hứng bởi Thomas Romain và Tania Palumbo cùng tạo hình nhân vật Jeremie Belpois trong phim “Code Lyoko”. Có lẽ các bạn thế hệ của tôi không còn xa lạ gì bộ phim này đâu nhỉ (Thật ra cho đến gần cuối năm trung học tôi còn chưa biết tên 2 tác giả của bộ phim đâu @@). Nội dung chính của bộ phim nói về một nhóm thiếu niên cùng đi vào thế giới ảo có tên Lyoko để chống lại thế lực X.A.N.A có mục đích đe dọa đến trái đất. Nghe thôi đã thấy hào hứng rồi, cùng với sự ngầu lòi của các nhân vật, sáng tạo trong cách chiến đấu và sự thông minh của “Einstein” (đây là tên mà mọi người gọi Jeremie Belpois). Tôi chưa bỏ lỡ tập nào và cái hình dáng của mấy con boss, crep vẫn còn xuất hiện mỗi khi có ai đó nhắc đến lyoko hay điều gì tương tự. Nhưng như vậy vẫn chưa đủ vì đấy chứa 90% làm lý do để tôi có thể xem phim hoạt hình mà không cảm thấy tội lỗi. Đến bây giờ vẫn có người nói với tôi: “Thật tốt vì bạn có thể biết được mình mong muốn gì và điều bản thân mình thực sự thích từ sớm”. Đúng vậy, 10% còn lại của tôi là muốn được chơi game, thật là một điều mong muốn tuyệt vời nhỉ?\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <img style=\"border-radius: 8px\" width=\"100%\" src=\"img/for_me/lyoko.jpg\" />\r\n                  <p class=\"font-handel text-multi\">\r\n                    <br /><br />Không như các anh chị đi trước, mọi người đều rất chăm chỉ tìm hiểu và tiếp cận lập trình từ rất sớm. Tôi thì khác, đến khi kết thúc THPT trong tôi chưa có khái niệm cụ thể nào về kiến thức CNTT. Tại thời điểm đó, tôi chưa bao giờ thắc mắc website được tạo ra như thế nào? Tại sao game lại vận hành được theo thao tác của người dùng? Tại sao khi có quá nhiều xử lý trong một thời điểm mà vẫn có thể vận hành mượt mà đến vậy?... Ok, khá lan man rồi, kết thúc THPT tôi quyết định thi quân sự (nhìn vậy chứ tôi đủ tiêu chuẩn thi quân đội đấy :)))) ), và trường tôi chọn là Sỹ quan Thông tin. Tôi trượt trong cả 2 năm thi, đến thời điểm đó tôi không còn biết thực sự mình nên học gì và làm gì sắp tới, tôi còn dự định sẽ không tiếp tục học nữa. Nhưng thật là duyên số và bổn phận không cho phép (bố mẹ tôi không có ý định đấy, vậy là bố tôi quyết định tạm thời sẽ cho đi học tại ĐH Vinh - chuyên ngành gì về kinh tế thì phải). Tôi vốn ghét mấy cái sự gò bó, nghe đến kinh tế đã thấy không có cảm hứng rồi. “Bố qua trường con học đi, CNTT điểm nguyện vọng 2 thấp thôi.” đấy là tin nhắn của “con gái” tôi (con gái tôi xinh lắm nhé! :))))).

On sunny days, I love taking photos, and I enjoy admiring the beauty of nature. Or with some friends, we take suburbs. I have intuitive thinking, and photography along with the trips that help me turn my thoughts into reality. Rainy days, when I'm forced to stay in my house. I reading, listening to soft music. I absolutely love reading. Whether it's reading an article, fiction and non- fiction. Reading is a really good way to learn new things.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />I like to follow the big Software co's like Google, Facebook, Amazon and how they are doing and evolving. How they achieve such success. What are their leaders like. And I spend a large amount of my free time designing and development websites, I grasping new technologies and techniques in the industry to improve their professional qualifications, and meet the changing requirements of the job.\n                  </p>\n                  <button\n                    type=\"button\"\n                    class=\"font-handel btn btn-success btn-sm\"\n                    data-toggle=\"modal\"\n                    data-target=\"#open-cv\"\n                  >Curriculum Vitae</button>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </card>\n\n        <!-- Modal -->\n\n        <div\n          id=\"open-cv\"\n          class=\"modal fade bd-example-modal-lg\"\n          tabindex=\"-1\"\n          role=\"dialog\"\n          aria-labelledby=\"myLargeModalLabel\"\n          aria-hidden=\"true\"\n        >\n          <div class=\"modal-dialog modal-lg modal-dialog-centered\">\n            <div class=\"modal-content\">\n              <div class=\"modal-header\">\n                <h4 class=\"modal-title\">My Curriculum Vitae</h4>\n                <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-label=\"Close\">\n                  <span aria-hidden=\"true\">&times;</span>\n                </button>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"modal-body\">\n                <a href=\"https://tuannv95.github.io/profile/cv/TuanNguyen-CV.pdf\">TuanNguyen-CV.pdf</a>\n                <!-- Content -->\n                <!-- <pdf src=\"cv/TuanNguyen-CV-trang-1.pdf\"></pdf>\n                <pdf src=\"cv/TuanNguyen-CV-trang-2.pdf\"></pdf>\n                <pdf src=\"cv/TuanNguyen-CV-trang-3.pdf\"></pdf>\n                <pdf src=\"cv/TuanNguyen-CV-trang-4.pdf\"></pdf> -->\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"modal-footer\">\n                <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close</button>\n                <button id=\"download-cv\" type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Download</button>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport Modal from \"@/components/Modal.vue\";\nimport Tabs from \"@/components/Tabs/Tabs.vue\";\nimport TabPane from \"@/components/Tabs/TabPane.vue\";\n//import pdf from \"vue-pdf\";\nimport GoTop from '@inotom/vue-go-top';\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    Modal,\n    Tabs,\n    TabPane,\n    //pdf,\n    GoTop\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      modals: {\n        modal1: false\n      }\n    };\n  }\n};\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  $('#title-all').text(\"Tuan Nguyen - Profile\");\n  $(\"#download-cv\").click(function() {\n    window.location.href =\n      \"https://tuannv95.github.io/profile/cv/TuanNguyen-CV.pdf\";\n  });\n  $(\"#fb\").click(function() {\n    window.location.href =\n      \"https://www.facebook.com/tuan.naem\";\n  });\n  $(\"#ig\").click(function() {\n    window.location.href =\n      \"https://www.instagram.com/tuan_2425/\";\n  });\n});\n</script>\n<style>\n.font-handel {\n  font-family: Metropolis, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto,\n    Helvetica Neue, Arial, sans-serif, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji,\n    Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji !important;\n}\n.text-multi {\n  text-align: justify;\n}\n.modal-lg {\n  max-width: 970px !important;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./BaseDropdown.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./BaseDropdown.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\""],"sourceRoot":""}
